# ROADMAP

* Plan meetings to discuss strategy for doing important stuff
* Write draft strategy for doing the important stuff
* Fix other urgent stuff because it's urgent
* Rework draft for strategy for doing the important stuff because everything changed during the time of fixing the other urgent stuff
* Do some stuff that is completely unrelated to the strategy for the important stuff pending the finalization of the strategy for doing important stuff
* Get final approval for the strategy for doing important stuff
* Start doing important stuff
* Stop everything you're doing because the important stuff doesn't compile on armv5
